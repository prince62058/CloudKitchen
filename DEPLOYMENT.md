# Vercel Deployment Guide for Yashavee Cloud Kitchen

## Quick Deploy Steps

### 1. Build the Project
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

## Image Loading Issues Fix

The project has been optimized for Vercel deployment with the following improvements:

### ✅ Implemented Solutions

1. **OptimizedImage Component**: Smart image loading with category-based fallbacks
2. **Image Optimization**: All Unsplash URLs optimized with proper parameters
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and fallback system
4. **CORS Headers**: Proper headers configured in vercel.json
5. **Build Configuration**: Optimized build process for Vercel

### 🔧 Technical Details

**Image URLs are now optimized with**:
- Proper width/height parameters (800x600)
- Format optimization (`auto=format`)
- Quality optimization (`q=80`)
- Crop optimization (`fit=crop`)

**Fallback System**:
- Category-specific fallbacks for Indian, Chinese, Italian, South Indian, and Desserts
- Smart category detection based on dish names
- Multiple fallback levels for maximum reliability

### 📝 Environment Setup

Make sure these environment variables are set in Vercel:
```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
```

### 🚀 Deployment Commands

**For Fresh Deployment**:
```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

**For Updates**:
```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod --force
```

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

If images still don't load on Vercel:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Open browser dev tools to see specific error messages
2. **Network Tab**: Check if image requests are failing
3. **Fallback Check**: Verify if fallback images are loading
4. **CORS Issues**: Ensure external image domains allow cross-origin requests

### 📊 Expected Behavior

**Development**: All images should load with success messages in console
**Production**: Images should load with fallbacks if originals fail

### 🔍 Debugging

The OptimizedImage component now logs:
- ✅ Successful image loads
- ❌ Failed image loads with URLs
- 🔄 Fallback image usage

Check browser console for these messages to debug image loading issues.
